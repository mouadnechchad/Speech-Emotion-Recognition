# Speech-Emotion-Recognition

I have built some Machine Learning models and measured their performances to recognize some predefined emotions expressed in audios.

Models used:

- Support Vector Machine (SVM).
- Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP).
- Decision Tree (DT).
- Random Forest (RF).
  
One important point I have noted is that when I have decrased the number of emotions to recognize from eight to four, the performance of the model used has increased.

The dataset used and its description is [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uwrfkaggler/ravdess-emotional-speech-audio).
